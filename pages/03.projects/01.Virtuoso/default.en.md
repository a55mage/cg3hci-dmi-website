## Abstract
Holidays are often experienced as a momentary
life change, away from the stressful routine of
everyday life in the city and at work. With this in mind, many
take this opportunity to dedicate time to themselves and to
own psycho-physical well-being, with an eye to form
physical and the other to relax. In this regard, the centers
tourist offer many alternatives, such as fitness centers,
water courses, organized excursions and spa. Usually
the choice between the various activities proposed is made by the customer in complete autonomy and without any support from the accommodation facility.
What we propose with this project is to provide a
set of tools, simple to use, that are not
necessarily require the help of health personnel
specialist (doctor or paramedic) to assist him
tour operators, especially fitness and wellness
trainer or coach (a new specialized figure that you go
increasingly affirming in contexts such as the one described),
in the activity of addressing and guiding customers in
choice and practice of fitness and relaxation activities
offered by the tourist facility.

The main tool we will develop a computerized application for
general assessment of the psycho-physical conditions of the
customer. In addition, we will create an application
for the end user to consult the information produced by the center, 
archive them and possibly share them with other users through channels 
such as, for example, social networks.
For this purpose we foresee a complete study path and the
development of methods and techniques for analysing of the state of
general health of an individual, based on heterogeneous data
acquired by non-invasive and non-intrusive sensors and contactless sensors, 
(for example, cameras and platforms with sensors), or with minimal contact, 
such as, for example, multification bracelets. The fundamental idea behind the whole
project is evaluating the conditions and the psycho-physical properties
 of an individual and derive indications on the best wellness path 
 suitable for them, through an analysis of diagnostic signs collected with several
techniques and technologies.

The collaboration with a group of physiologists from the University
of Cagliari who will deal with the identification of
parameters to check, the definition of their
normal range and the application validation
once developed, ensures that the system has
solid biological foundations, despite having no presumption
to represent a clinical health diagnosis system.
The final result will therefore be twofold: on the one hand,
will support tourist facilities, even those not
highly specialized in this area, in providing
innovative and personalized services, aimed at wellness
customers; on the other hand, the predisposition will be exploited
by people on vacation to change their lifestyle,
taking advantage of the options provided by the hotel, and to suggest them 
a correct lifestyle more appropriate to their peculiarities. 
The mobile application will ensure that this guidance also follows 
them in the return to daily life, with personalized advice
related to physical activity and diet.

The project was funded by the [Sardinian Regional Government](https://www.regione.sardegna.it/) and ended in 2017.
