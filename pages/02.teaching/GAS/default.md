## Geometric Algorithms and Spatial Data Structures (GAS)

_The course is available only in English_
Knowledge and understanding:

* Know the main algorithms used to solve problems modeled using simple tools of Euclidean geometry in the plane and space
* Know what they are and how to use the data structures for the description of geometric entities in the plane and space
* Understand the classification of the paradigms that guide the design of algorithms (geometric and not) by distinguishing the various types of algorithms used

Applying knowledge and understanding:

* Being able to make an accurate empirical evaluation of computational complexity (both in time and in space) of the algorithms studied
* Design and implement an interactive application based on one of the algorithms seen during the course
* Use, in an advanced way, software development tools based on the C++ language

Making judgments

* Develop independently, concerning the design and implementation choices, the final project from the specifications provided

Communication skills

* Understand, summarize and expose a scientific text, written in English, treating in-depth one of the topics covered during the course

Learning skills

* Use multiple sources to solve the exercises assigned as homework
