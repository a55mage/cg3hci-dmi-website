#Programming Courses

## Web Programming (FPW)
The course provides the student with the basic knowledge for the creating, 
understanding and designing web applications. The course introduces 
step-by-step the main technologies and problems in developing internet 
applications, starting from the HTTP protocol, to server-side and 
client-side programming, which are presented using standard technologies, 
widespread in professional environments.

#Courses in HCI

## Human Computer Interaction (IUM)
The course provides an introduction to the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
field and to the main aspects involved in the human interaction with 
different devices. The course provides the concepts and the knowledge 
for understanding the human cognitive process for elaborating information, 
and the techniques and tools for designing, implementing and evaluating 
interfaces for interactive systems. In addition, we discuss the different 
modalities and platforms for creating user interfaces, from classical WIMP, 
to mobile, ubiquitous, distributed and natural interfaces.

## User Interface Technologies (UIT)
The course provides the knowledge for understanding and exploiting different 
technologies for developing user interfaces, starting from the simplest ones 
(form-based on a single device) to the more complex ones (multi-device, 
augmented and virtual reality etc.), with examples of different interaction 
styles and modalities. The student will learn how to prototype them in an 
effective way, in order to include different techniques into the application 
at hand. Finally, the course will discuss the software architectures for 
developing user interfaces their evolution through the user interface history 
and examples of modern development toolkits.
