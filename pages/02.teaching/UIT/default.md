##User Interface Technologies (UIT)
_The course is available only in English_

The course provides the knowledge for understanding and exploiting different 
technologies for developing user interfaces, starting from the simplest ones 
(form-based on a single device) to the more complex ones (multi-device, 
augmented and virtual reality etc.), with examples of different interaction 
styles and modalities. The student will learn how to prototype them in an 
effective way, in order to include different techniques into the application 
at hand. Finally, the course will discuss the software architectures for 
developing user interfaces their evolution through the user interface history 
and examples of modern development toolkits.
