The CG3HCI Lab is an interdisciplinary research team which is part of the Mathematics and Computer Science 
Department of the University of Cagliari, Italy. 

The group research focuses 
mainly on Computer Graphics (CG) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
Prof. Riccardo Scateni, who founded the group in 2007, leads the research in CG, 
while Prof. Davide Spano, who joined the team in 2012, leads the research in HCI. 
In addition, the group counts different Post-Docs and research fellows, together with 
students at different levels (PhD candidates, Master and Bachelor students).

The group participated in different European, Italian and Sardinian research projects. 
A summary is available in the [Projects page](../projects).
